# Introduction
For my tools I use my favourite programming language, python.<br>
Currently the tools don't have a gui.<br>
I'll probably add them, but for now, I prefer using my time improving the tools in other ways.

# Requirements for my tools

First, you'll need to install the python interpreter from [their website](https://python.org) or from the [Microsoft store](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/python-311/9NRWMJP3717K) if you're on a windows machine.<br>
This is the program that will read and execute my tools' code.<br>
Make sure it installed successfully using the command line<br>
`python -V`<br>
<br>
After that, you're almost done, you only need to install the packages for the toolset

# Installing the packages

Every tool requires different packages.<br>
In every repository there's a readme in which you can find all the specific information for that project.<br>
The command for installing a package is<br>
`pip install [package name]`<br>
For example, if you want to install numpy, you'll write<br>
`pip install numpy`
